0,Calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x,"
1. Find the derivative of the function f(x) by using the power rule for differentiation: d/dx[x^n] = n * x^(n-1), where n is the exponent of x in the function.
2. Apply this rule to each term in the function, f(x) = x^3 + 2x.
3. Differentiate x^3: d/dx[x^3] = 3 * x^2
4. Differentiate 2x: d/dx[2x] = 2 * d/dx[x] = 2 * 1 = 2
5. Combine the derivatives of each term to find the overall derivative: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2","
1. Identify the function: f(x) = x^3 + 2x
2. Apply the power rule for differentiation: d/dx[x^n] = n * x^(n-1), where n is the exponent of x in the function.
3. Differentiate each term separately: d/dx[x^3] = 3x^2, d/dx[2x] = 2
4. Combine the derivatives: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2", A
