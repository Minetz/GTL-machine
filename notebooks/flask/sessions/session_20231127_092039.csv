0,Calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x,"
","
1. Define the function: f(x) = x^3 + 2x
2. Identify the terms and powers to differentiate: u(x) = 3x^2, v(x) = 2x
3. Use the power rule of differentiation: d/dx[u(x)] = 6x, d/dx[v(x)] = 1
4. Apply the power rule to each term and add the results: d/dx[f(x)] = (d/dx[u(x)]) + (d/dx[v(x)]) = (6x) + (1) = 6x + 1
5. Write the final derivative as a new function: f'(x) = 6x + 1

1,Calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x,"
","
1. Identify the function: f(x) = x^3 + 2x
2. Write down the power rule for differentiation: d/dx[x^n] = n * x^(n-1)
3. Apply the power rule to each term of the function: (d/dx)[x^3] = 3x^(3-1), (d/dx)[2x] = 2 * (d/dx)[x]
4. Differentiate each term and combine the results: (d/dx)[f(x)] = d/dx[x^3 + 2x] = 3x^(3-1) + 2 * (d/dx)[x]
5. Use the constant rule for differentiation: d/dx[c] = 0
6. Substitute x and c with their respective variables: 3x^(3-1) + 2(d/dx)[x]
7. Simplify the expression: 3x^2 + 2(d/dx)[x]
8. Use the constant rule for differentiation again: d/dx[c] = 0

2,Calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 2x,"
","
1. Identify the function: f(x) = x^3 + 2x
2. Rewrite the function in power rule form: f'(x) = d/dx(x^3 + 2x) = d/dx(x^3) + d/dx(2x) = 3x^2 + 2
3. Apply the power rule to find the derivative of x^3 and 2x separately: d/dx(x^3) = 3x^2, d/dx(2x) = 4x
4. Combine the derivatives of x^3 and 2x: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x
5. Verify the result by substituting x = 1 back into the function and its derivative: f(1) = 1^3 + 2(1) = 1 + 2 = 3, f'(1) = 3(1)^2 + 4(1) = 3 + 4 = 7
6. The correct result is achieved: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x", B
