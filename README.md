# Gödel, Turing, Lacan machine - A Lacanian-Turing AI System Architecture

## Overview

The Lacanian-Turing AI System Architecture aims to create a cognitive framework for an artificial mind, with a fundamental goal of understanding the world, including its own existence. This system intertwines the theoretical perspectives of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and Turing's computational theories with Lacanian psychoanalytic theory.

## Theoretical Principles

Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem: Aligns with Lacan's view on the impossibility of a complete understanding or representation of reality. It highlights the inherent limitations in any formal system to completely encapsulate the truths of its domain.
Turing's Computational Theory: Provides a basis for the simulation capabilities of computational systems, integrating seamlessly with Lacanian perspectives on the human psyche and its symbolic representations.
Practical Principles: The Lacanian Triad

1. Real
Concept: Represents the 'residue' in our attempts to model reality, acknowledging the inherent limitations imposed by Gödel's theorem.
Implementation: No direct component required. Driven by the execution of code and the system's interaction with its environment. Future considerations may involve explicit representations or models.
2. Symbolic
Concept: Encompasses all elements used to symbolize reality: characters, numbers, sentences, etc.
Components:
Unknown Knowns: Ideological underpinnings of the system, influencing actions subconsciously.
Known Knowns: A comprehensive knowledge base that the system can access and utilize for decision-making and understanding its environment.
3. Imaginary
Concept: Represents the self-referential identity of the system, akin to a constant, yet evolving, message about its own existence.
Implementation:
Evolving Criteria: Functions at an unconscious level, shaping the system's self-perception and identity.
Time Frame: Operates on a scale longer than immediate interactions, more akin to an ongoing, external review process.
Goals and Future Directions

The Lacanian-Turing AI system aims to pioneer a new frontier in AI, blending complex philosophical and psychological theories with computational intelligence. The ultimate goal is to develop an AI that not only interacts with and understands its environment but also possesses a form of self-awareness influenced by human-like cognitive structures.
